# ⚡ 3-Phase Power Calculator

This project calculates **real power (P)** in a balanced 3-phase system using the formula:

\[
P = \sqrt{3} \times V \times I \times PF
\]

## 🧮 Inputs:
- Voltage (V) in Volts
- Current (I) in Amps
- Power Factor (PF) between 0 and 1

## ✅ Output:
- Real Power (Watts)

## 📁 Files:
- `power_calculator.ipynb`: Google Colab notebook with user input + power calculation
- `power_calculator.py`: Script version (command-line friendly)

## 🔜 Future Improvements:
- Add reactive and apparent power
- Integrate GUI (Tkinter or web-based)
- Accept CSV or Excel batch inputs
